# Bayesian-Analysis-Educational-Spending

The goal of this project is to examine the relationship between individual state spending in the United States on education and the achievement of students in each state. The data set for the project comes from Kaggle.com[1]. The data on state spending comes from the United States Census Bureau Annual Survey of School System Finances. This annual survey includes statistics on revenue, debt, and assets for all states, including the District of Columbia[2]. The National Assesment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a national assessment that measures student achievement in various subjects[3].

The following variables will be used to measure the relationship with state spending and student achievement:

    Average test scores for each state (obtained from NAEP)
    Per student spending on education (obtained from Census Bureau Annual Survey of School System Finances)
